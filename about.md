This website was created to publicly record how many Members of Parliament sitting in the UK Parliament's House of Commons are LGBT+.

The dataset shows Members of Parliament who are ‘out’ as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity.

Members of Parliament are only included where it is clear that the individual has made an affirmative decision to reveal their identity publicly. This information has been collated from internet searches and publicly available information. Members of Parliament are only listed if a reliable source has been found to verify the individual's identity. These sources might include media reporting or personal testimony.

## Citations and references

This dataset has been used by journalists at the BBC, Sky News and Quartz, and cited in academic publications. It has also cited as a source on Wikipedia.
