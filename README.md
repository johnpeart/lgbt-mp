# LGBT+ Members of Parliament dataset

![](https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/blob/main/assets/images/site/social-media.png)

This dataset was created to publicly record how many Members of Parliament sitting in the UK Parliament’s House of Commons are LGBT+.

The dataset shows Members of Parliament who are ‘out’ as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity.

Members of Parliament are only included where it is clear that the individual has made an affirmative decision to reveal their identity publicly. This information has been collated from internet searches and publicly available information. Members of Parliament are only listed if a reliable source has been found to verify the individual’s identity. These sources might include media reporting or personal testimony.

## Present day

The purpose of this dataset is to show how many LGBT+ MPs **currently** in the House of Commons – today. This might differ from the number of MPs that were elected at the start of a Parliament, and how many remain in the House of Commons by the time of the following General Election.

You can see the LGBT+ MPs who are currently in the House of Commons by visiting [www.lgbt.mp](//www.lgbt.mp)

## Historical datasets

The LGBT Members of Parliament website makes it easy to see how many MPs were in Parliament on the day that Parliament started and the day that Parliament was disolved.

These can be accessed on the [Historic Parliaments page](https://www.lgbt.mp/historic/).

## CSV data

You can see all data, for all MPs currently recorded in the dataset, in [CSV format](https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/blob/main/_data/members.csv).
