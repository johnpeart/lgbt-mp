		<p><strong>Which MPs in the UK House of Commons define as LGBT?</strong></p>

		<p>When I tried to find out the answer in early 2017, Google, to my surprise, couldnâ€™t answer that question for me when I tried to find out. So I did some research and compiled the list myself, using publicly available information, and then I made this website.</p>

		<p>The data collected shows Members of Parliament who are 'out' as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and for which I can find a reliable source.</p>

		<p>I intend to keep it as up-to-date as possible. If you think this this dataset could be improved, the you can contribute on <a href="{{ 'https://github.com/johnpeart' | append: site.baseurl | append: '/tree/master/_data' }}" title="View the datasets on Github">Github</a>.</p>
