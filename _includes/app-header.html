				<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>
				
				<p>This website was created to publicly record how many out LGBT MPs were sitting in the House of Commons.</p>
				
				<p>The data collected shows Members of Parliament who are ‘out’ as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and for which I can find a reliable source.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Select an MP’s name to see their constituency and where the source of this information came from.</strong></p>
				
				<h1 id="structured-data">Structured data</h1>
				
				<p>This dataset is available as a <a href="https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/tree/master/_data" tabindex="0">CSV file on Github</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The file contains historical data, starting with the 2015 to 2017 Parliament.</p>
				
				<h1 id="sources">Sources</h1>
				
				<p>This information has been collated from internet searches and publicly available information. An MP is listed either when an MP has made a public statement about their sexual orientation or gender identity, or there is a reliable independent source.</p>
				
				<p>The main sources so far have been <a href="//pinknews.co.uk" tabindex="0">Pink News</a>, the <a href="//independent.co.uk" tabindex="0">The Independent</a>. More recently, I have also cross-referenced with data from <a href="//lgbtqrepresentationandrights.org/" tabindex="0">The LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative</a></p>
