**Which MPs in the UK House of Commons define as LGBT?**

Surprisingly, Google couldn't answer that question for me when I tried to find out. 

So I did some research and compiled the list myself, and then I made this website.

The data collected shows Members of Parliament who have 'come' out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and for which I can find a reliable source.

I intend to keep it as up-to-date as possible.
